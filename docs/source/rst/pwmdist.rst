pwmdist package
===============

The package consists of functions related to generalized pareto distribution.


gpdpwmFit module
----------------
The 'gpdpwmFit' module aims to fit a given set of data with generalized pareto distribution using 
probability weighted moments to calculate the parameter esimates. The package also provides an estimate of Risk measures.

gpdplots module
---------------
The 'gpdplots' module aims to provide a pictoral view of tail of the distribution,
emperical distribution, quantile function plot and tails etimates as of now.
